== Thoughtfulr

houghtfulr is an app that sends users daily positive messages, straight to their phone or email.

The pool of daily messages sent to users are all generated by users themselves, so to ensure that the pool continues to grow, users must “send to receive.” In other words, a user will only receive their daily message if they have out more messages than they have already received. If I’ve contributed 5 messages to the message pool, and I’ve received 3 so far, I will receive 2 more daily messages before I run out.

Daily messages are sent to users with the moniker and location of the user who sent it. Users select their moniker and location when they register for an account. Monikers are usually either initials or “anonymous.”
