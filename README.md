# Thoughtfulr

Thoughtfulr is an app that sends users daily positive messages, straight to their phone or email.

The pool of daily messages sent to users are all generated by users themselves, so to ensure that the pool continues to grow, users must “send to receive.” In other words, a user will only receive their daily message if they have sent out more messages than they have already received.

Daily messages are sent to users with the moniker and location of the user who sent it. Users select their moniker and location when they register for an account.
